# Comitto

Git can be overwhelming: too many commands, inconsistent commit styles, confusing branch names. Developers spend more time managing changes than writing code.

**Comitto** is a simple CLI tool to fix that:
- Interactive, opinionated commits with a single standard.
- Automatic branch naming based on your project’s rules.
- One-step GitHub PR creation.
- Minimal setup—install and forget about Git complexity.

Goal: **make Git work for you, not against you**.
